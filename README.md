# Pomodoro Timer

A Pomodoro Timer app built with React.js.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. This technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This timer helps you stay focused and productive by working in short bursts and taking regular breaks.

## Features

- Start, pause, and reset the timer.
- Toggle between dark mode and light mode.
- Display the timer in minutes and seconds format.
- Automatically stop the timer at 25 minutes.

## Configuration

To adjust the time for the work session or customize other settings, you can modify the code in the `Timer` component. Open the `Timer.js` file in the `src/components` directory and make the necessary changes.
